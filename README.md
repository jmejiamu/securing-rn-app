# 📱 Mobile App Security Series — React Native + Node

This project is a companion app for my video series on securing **React Native + Node/Express** applications.

Each screen in the app demonstrates a common security vulnerability and its proper fix.

---

## 🎯 The Goal

- How vulnerabilities happen
- How they are exploited
- How to fix them correctly
- How mobile apps interact with backend security

---

## 🧠 What This Project Is

This is a **learning-focused demo app**, not a production app.

It includes:

- A React Native frontend (TypeScript)
- Multiple demo screens (via Drawer Navigator)
- Separate Node/Express demo servers for each vulnerability
- Vulnerable and fixed versions for comparison
